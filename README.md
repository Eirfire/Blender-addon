IMPORT!!!! (render and shutdown is not working at the moment due to a bug) 
1. This addon only really works for rendering animations at the moment further support for single image renders will be added in the future.
2. Make sure you save all the files on your computer before you render out the animation as lose of files from other software might happen if does occur i take no responsibility for lose of files 


Hello my name is Jacob and I have created this addon for people that don't want to leave their computers on after a render is finished, this addon can do other things like displace objects change camera settings and much more. the whole addon is still in early devolment and still needs to be fixed and worked on. I'm new to coding and the Python API so if you have any better ways to do something please let me know and show me how you would do it and I'll see if I can implement it into the addon.
