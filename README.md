IMPORT!!!!
1. This addon only really works for rendering animations at the moment further support for single image renders will be added in the future.
2. Make sure you save all the files on your computer before you render out the animation as lose of files from other software might happen if does occur i take no responsibility for lose of files 
3. when you reopen your blend file make sure to turn off the check box this will hopefully be fixed in future versions

Hello my name is Jacob and I have created this addon for people that don't want to leave their computers on after a render is finished I'm new to coding in the Python API so if you have any better ways to do something please let me know and show how you would do it and I'll see if I can implement it into the addon
